	Params: event_id:String, email:String, message:String
	Return: Success object
	If email corresponds to a user, sends a meeting link via email and adds event_id to the user's invite list. . If not a user, sends a sign-up link and stores event_id to be added when the new user signs up. If the email does not include a domain, assumes @oswego.edu. If there is a domain other than @oswego.edu, returns an error message and does not send any email.

	Adds block to user's blocked list. Parameter name only matters for determining who can unblock.

   E4.3 POST /friend/unblock

	Return: Success object
	Removes blocked from user's blocked list. This will not affect the blocked status if it was mutual before.
