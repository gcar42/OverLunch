Purpose and goals
The purpose of the OverLunch app is to provide a convenient way for students to find a lunch companion while on the Suny Oswego campus. As such, it should function intuitively on mobile devices. The primary functions users may expect include:
	Create an event
	Browse events
	Sort/ filter displayed events
	Join an event
	Cancel an event
	Remove self from an event

Other features users may expect include:
	Identify other users they would like to meet for lunch (friends list)
	A user profile page with a name, email address, and perhaps a photo
