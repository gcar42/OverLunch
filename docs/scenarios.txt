SCENARIOS:
S1.0 Initial Setup
	Matt receives an (goal)invitation via email(/goal) to use OverLunch from his classmate Charles. Charles had already told Matt about the app, so Matt clicks the link. 
	A browser window opens prompting Matt to enter his (Constraint)Oswego.edu email address(/Constraint) and select either sign-in or sign-up. 
	He enters his email address and selects the sign-up option. He is prompted to enter a Screen Name (which is what other users will see) and to create a password for the OverLunch app. The display tells him that an email confirmation link has been sent to his address. 
	The email will contain a link to start using OverLunch. 

S2.0 Browsing events
	Matt clicks the link in his confirmation email and is taken to the OverLunch Login screen.
	After entering his email address in the Email field and password in the password field, Matt clicks the login button and is shown the Overlunch home screen.
	The home screen shows a list of cards representing the lunch events of other OverLunch users. 
	He notices that the events occurring soonest are on the top of the list. (default sort, no filters).
	Aside from the event tiles, he sees 2 obvious buttons:
		One is a plus sign that hovers near the bottom of the screen (New Event), 
		and the other is funnel-shaped icon near the top-right of the screen (Filter and Sort options).
   
   S2.1 Sort Events
	Clicking the funnel, Matt toggles the sort-order of the list of events to show the most recent events at the venues closest to his location.

   S2.2 Filter Events
	Matt scrolls through the list of events noticing that near the end of the list the cards are… 
		(a different color? Some visual cue to identify that these are for tomorrow, not today).
	He is interested in meeting someone for lunch today, so he clicks the funnel icon again, and selects the filter option to show only Today's events.
	The list updates (keeping his sort options) and tomorrow's events are no longer in the displayed list.
   
S3.0 Select an event/ view meeting details
	Matt selects the 1st even in the list, which is the one that will be occurring soonest, and a window showing more details opens. 
	The “Detail” view shows that SCREEN_NAME_ONE and SCREEN_NAME_TWO have expressed interest in this meeting at (VENUE), which could begin as soon as 11:30 and end as late 1:45 (Event Window).
	
   S3.1 Join an event: Interested
	This all sounds good to Matt. He still wants to look at other events, so he selects "I'm Interested" instead of the "I'll Be There" option, adding his name to the list with the other two users.
	The "I'll Be There" still appears, with tool to select a specific start and end time within the broader Event Window.
	
   S3.1 Join an event: Confirmed 
	Shortly after Matt joins the event, the bar at the top of the event changes color and displays the word "Confirmed". SCREEN_NAME_ONE has confirmed that (s)he will be there. 
	The the "I'll Be There" option is still available, but the time selection tool next to has vanished, replaced with "12:00 to 1:00".
	

S4.0
	Still looking at the Detail view of the event, Matt sees his name and Charles' under the heading "Interested".
	A moment later, Charles' name moves from "interested" to "Confirmed". 
	Another dialog opens with the message: "Your classmate Charles has confirmed for lunch at VENUE, from TIME_START to TIME_END. Would you like to confirm, too?".
	Matt taps "YES". His name in the detail view of the event moves from "Interested" to "Confirmed".

QUESTIONS/NOTES:
Do we need to display a list of friends? (YES)
       Select a friend to see his events? (Select a friend to see his user profile, which includes events to which the user is attached.)
  
How to handle notifications if this is a web-app?

I (Greg) started using the term "event" instead of "availability", following the lead of our interviewed users.
Instead of saying "Tentative" and "Confirmed", I suggest users are associate with events as either "Interested", or "Confirmed".
